baud_rate : 230400

# Controller type. 1 is HSS_CURRENT. See fxEnums.py in the flexsea repo
controller_type : 1

# Signal type. 1 is sine, 2 is line
signal_type : 1

# Cmd frequency. Frequency (in Hz) at which the device streams data
cmd_freq : 500

# Signal amplitude. If the controller is position, it's the encoder
# position. If the controller is current, it's the current in mA
signal_amplitude : 500

# nLoops. The number of times to send the desired signal to the
# controller. Proxy for run time.
nLoops : 4

# Signal frequency. Only applies if the signal type is a sine wave.
# This is the frequency of that sine wave.
signal_freq : 5

# Cycle delay. Only applies if the signal type is a sine wave. Gives
# the delay between signals sent to the controller.
cycle_delay : 0.1

# Request jitter. If True, Gaussian noise (jitter) is added to each
# signal sent to the controller.
request_jitter : False

# Jitter. The mean of the Gaussian used to generate jitter. The
# variance of the distribution is numpy's default.
jitter : 20
